# My Favorite Media

This project was proposed by the formation ["From scratch: HTML and CSS for web projects"](https://www.alura.com.br/formacao-html-css) at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/), but I decided to use mainly JavaScript for this one.<br>
It is a page containing all my favorite piece of entertainment, including movies, TV shows and video games.
